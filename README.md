Moosic is a start-up creating personalized playlists curated by music experts.
Users can access playlists through various music apps (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music).
Rapid business growth has highlighted the slow pace of manual playlist creation.
You are hired to use Data Science for automating playlist creation.

Task: Use Spotify API data (audio features like tempo, energy, danceability) and apply K-Means clustering to group songs into playlists.
Team opinions vary: some doubt audio features can capture song "mood" accurately, others are hopeful about Data Science's potential.
Initial project iteration: develop a prototype, with no pressure for perfection.

Key assessments:
Can Spotify's audio features identify "similar songs" as humans do?
Is K-Means effective for creating playlists, or should other methods be explored?
Present clusters and discuss findings.
You havent been given a hard limit for the number of playlists, but you have been asked to keep the size of all the playlists between 50 and 250 songs ~~ 20-100 clusters
